I am a first-year PhD student at [the University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), advised by Prof. [Helge Rhodin](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rhodin/web/). 

My research interests lie in the area of Computer Vision and Graphics. Specifically, I'm particularly interested in audio-visual joint learning, 3D generative models, arbitrary style transfer and image generation.

<!--Before this, I received my M.Sc degree st Shenzhen University. During this period, I work as an research assistant in the [Visual Computing Center](https://vcc.tech/index.html) ([VCC](https://vcc.tech/index.html)) led by [Prof. Hui Huang](https://vcc.tech/~huihuang) and was fortunate to work with [Prof. Minglun Gong](http://www.cs.mun.ca/~gong/) and [Prof. Hui Huang](https://vcc.tech/~huihuang). -->

<!-- Nelson Bighetti is a professor of artificial intelligence at the Stanford AI Lab. His research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. He leads the Robotic Neurobiology group, which develops self-reconfiguring robots, systems of self-organizing robots, and mobile sensor networks. -->
