I am a Master student in the [Visual Computing Center](https://vcc.tech/index.html) ([VCC](https://vcc.tech/index.html)) led by [Prof. Hui Huang](https://vcc.tech/~huihuang). 
Currently, I closely cooperate with [Prof. Minglun Gong](http://www.cs.mun.ca/~gong/) and [Prof. Hui Huang](https://vcc.tech/~huihuang). Before joining VCC, I received my Bachelor degree in Electronic Information Science and Technology at Shandong Agricultural University. 
And then I worked at Shanghai as software engineer for four years.

My research interests lie within deep learning for 3D generative models, arbitrary style transfer and image generation.
