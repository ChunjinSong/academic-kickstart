title: Global-to-Local Generative Model for 3D Shapes
# event: Academic Theme Conference
# event_url: https://example.org
summary: We introduce a novel global-to-local(G2L) approach for 3D model generation through building an adversarial network(GAN) to construct the overall structure of the shape while additional local discriminators to help yielding more plausible part geometries.
